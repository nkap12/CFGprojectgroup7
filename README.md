## Description

Gluten Free Recipe Search is a project using Edamam API to search for gluten-free recipes. The API has a database of almost 700,000 recipes and our app allows users to search and review recipe details all in one place before being directed to the recipe hosting site. 
Our site also allows users to rate recipes.

## How to run this project

You do not need to do anything to run our backend service as this is deployed to the cloud, but please follow the steps below to run the front end application:s
* From the 'group-7-gfrecipes-react-project' directory, run 'npm install' in the terminal
* Run 'npm start' in the terminal to start the development server

If you wish to access the reviews database where our data for ratings of recipes is being stored and uploaded, please use the following information in MySQL workbench by click Database // Connect to Database in the toolbar:

Hostname: reviews.cx9hvngv0zug.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com<br>
Port: 3306<br>
Username: admin<br>
Password: purple123<br>

Although ordinarily we would not want to make databases which give functionality or contain personal information public, we have done so in this case for ease of access for the purposes of our project and understanding the workings.

## How to use the project

Once you have set up the development servers simply type in your recipe keywords into the search bar on the landing page to find a range of gluten-free recipe ideas from around the world. From the search results choose a recipe and click on it to find out more information. If you find a recipe you like you can simply follow the link to the recipe site for full details.
